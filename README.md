# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robot-using-Arduino-Nano
In this project you will able to get a gesture controlling technology for navigating a car-robot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A Gesture Controlled Car is a robot that operates based on simple human gestures. The user wears a gesture device equipped with a sensor that detects hand movements in specific directions, translating them into corresponding movements of the robot. The robot and the gesture device communicate wirelessly via radio waves. This system utilizes accelerometer sensors embedded in a glove, replacing the traditional remote control for the car. By wearing this glove, the user can direct the car's forward, backward, left, and right movements, as well as control its speed using the same accelerometer sensor.

The car's mechanism allows for precise movement, with the front and rear wheels on either side rotating in opposite directionsâ€”one set clockwise and the other counterclockwise. This enables the car to spin around its axis without any forward or backward motion, allowing for sharp turns with ease. Additionally, the robotic arm of the system is designed to mimic human hand movements. It features four movable fingers, each with three joints, an opposing thumb, and a rotating wrist and elbow. The robotic arm follows the gestures made by the user through the glove, replicating the motions of a human hand.
